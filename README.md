# node-website
This project is for Online market for food items.
This project is developed with node js.
I have used css,html,java script for designing.
To access the website first you have to download the web.zip file from repository unzip it then instal node js on your system.
Run the file main.js "node main.js" command in node js promt so that a local server is created with port number 3000.
Then by clicking the buttons on the web site it will take you to other pages.
